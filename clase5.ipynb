    "Single Stock Trading:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Traditional valuation methods (PER, DCF, etc) are long-term and will not work well with short term trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are exposed to market-wide movements (beta). Even if our fundamentals are correct, these kind of events can cause selloffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Price movements follow a random walk, meaning that price changes are unpredictable and have no clear mean reverting behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The variance of a stock price grows linearly over time in a random walk. Small forecasting errors compound over time, making it difficult to time entries and exits.\n",

    "\n",
    "    - $dWt \\sim N(0,dt)$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $E[dW_t]=0$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $Var(dW_t)=E[(dWt)^2]=dt$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many ML models assume stationarity, however, stock prices follow a non-stationary process, meaning historical patterns may not hold in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike traditional ML problems, there's no clear \"ground truth\" for whether a stock will go up or down. Market conditions change, making training data quickly outdated (data drift).\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible Workaround. Pairs Trading:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instead of trying to predict absolute price movements, we can focus on the spread between two cointegrated assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the spread follows a mean-reverting process, we can trade based on statistical arbitrage instead of directional bets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - $dS_t=\\theta (\\mu - S_t)dt + \\sigma dW_t$\n",
    "\n",
    "What is \"Pairs Trading\"?:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pairs Trading is a market-neutral trading strategy that involves taking a long position in one asset and a short position in another, typically related, asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The idea is to exploit the relative price movements between the two assets rather than their absolute price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These assets must be historically correlated or cointegrated, meaning that, hopefully, the prices will revert to their historical relationship after any divergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Required Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Economic relation: Cointegration often arises when two assets are influenced by common economic factors or have an inherent economic relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-stationarity: Both series must be individually non-stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear combination is stationary: This implies that while the series may deviate from each other, these deviations have a stable, mean-reverting property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Market Neutrality: As mentioned, the strategy is designed to be insensitive to overall market movements, which can provide protection in volatile or bearish markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diversification: By focusing on relative price movements, pairs trading can offer diversification benefits, especially when added to a portfolio of traditional directional trades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Risks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Risk: The strategy relies heavily on the assumption that the relationship between the two assets will hold in the future as it did in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execution Risk: Slippage, transaction costs, and other market frictions can erode profitability, especially in high-frequency implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Liquidity Risk: If one or both assets in the pair become illiquid, it may be difficult to exit positions without significant loss."
