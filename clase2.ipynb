    "What is a market maker?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Market makers are liquidity providers that quote prices to buy or sell an asset, while also serving as a dealer, reducing transaction costs and facilitating trades.\n",
    "- They hold large amounts of stocks and are willing to buy/sell at the quoted price, this way they provide liquidity for the retail investors.\n",
    "- Since they facilitate trades with a bid/ask quote, they get to profit from spreads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of traders:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Informed traders: They know what the price should be, or have information that others don't, through research (not insider information).\n",
    "- Liquidity traders: Investors, or long-term traders that don't mind paying spreads to buy stocks, ETFs or 401k cashouts.\n",
    "- Noisy traders: They think they have something special, but they don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market makers profit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Informed traders: $-$ profit.\n",
    "- Liquidity traders: $+$ profit.\n",
    "- Noisy traders: $+$ profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Publicly available information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reports (earning calls, inflation rates, bonds, etc).\n",
    "- New articles.\n",
    "- Journals."

    "## Effective spread\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The field of market microstructure deals with the costs of providing transaction services and with the impact of such costs on the short run behavior of securities prices.\n",
    "- Costs are reflected in the bid-ask spread (and related measures) and commissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spread:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The spread can be measured as the difference between Bid and Ask prices.\n",
    "- How would you explain the existence of a spread in a efficient market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the spread:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we define the spread as: $S=P_A-P_B$. But this can be hard to calculate, since there is not always a quoted bid/ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective spread:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Richard Roll proposes a simple way to measure the effective bid-ask spread by just using historical data.\n",
    "- However, this requires two main assumptions:\n",
    "    - The asset is traded in an informationally efficient market.\n",
    "    - The probability of distribution of observer price changes is stationary (at least for short intervals of, say, two months)."
